	abstract = {In recent decades, the use of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) imaging of organs has been growing rapidly compared to its two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS) type. The use of freehand technique in 3DUS system may help to improve the natural flexibility performance. To realize a 3DUS freehand imaging, a position tracking system which measures the US probe position in real time is added. The design, simulation, and analysis of a new 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) manipulator-based position tracking system for 3DUS probe are presented in this paper. The forward kinematics of the manipulator was calculated using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) convention. The position of end-effector, which represented the US probe position, was then measured using the joint parameters. The mathematical equations were then verified using Robotic Toolbox in MATLAB as the simulation software. The results of both simulation and equation verified the validity of the kinematic equations.},

	abstract = {The proportion of composite materials used in modern aircraft primary structures is continuously increasing because of their high mechanical performance and low density allowing for significant weight savings. Various factors can harm composite parts during the in-service life of the aircraft (impacts, collisions, lightning strikes, dropped tools, etc.) causing subsurface damages such as delaminations or disbonds. The structural integrity should therefore be verified throughout the lifetime of the aircraft. Ultrasonic testing (UT) is the preferred method to perform non-destructive inspection of composite aerospace components. Most of the in-service inspections are performed using manual UT techniques, which are easily deployed and often give satisfying results but also have strong limitations, the main one being the impossibility to get images as inspection results. Obtaining C-scan is highly desirable for in-service applications in order to increase the probability of detection, improve the results traceability or provide guidance for repairs. Different phased-array solutions exist to obtain C-scans for in-service inspections but they require the use of mechanical encoders or scanners which also bring their own limitations: limited inspection surface, restrictions on the operator movement, problems adapting the scanner to curves and complex geometries inherent to an aircraft. We present a novel inspection technique using a portable phased-array UT instrument coupled to a dynamic tracking system based on stereoscopic cameras. The 3D vision device follows the trajectory of a custom target mounted on the phased-array probe. A software application was developed to perform real-time transformation of the 3D linear and angular coordinates into the 2D scan-index coordinates and skew angle required by the UT instrument. A complex double curvature aerospace component was inspected with the developed method. The UT probe was moved freely in any direction on the inspected surface (Paintbrush movement) without any physical encoder nor scanner attached to it. Ultrasonic C-scans were generated. The accuracy of the defects positioning and sizing as well as the overall performance of the method are discussed.},
